Below you can find some examples of some projects that I have done. I usually use Github to deploy all of my work.<br>

### Password Manager
* This program allows a user to make an account which then allows the user to store passwords that they may have on various websites so the user doesn't have to remember them. This program also allows the user to edit and delete passwords that they may have stored. This program is written in python and uses the Database SQlite3.

### PC Builder
* This is a website that I created using HTML and CSS and the purpose of this website was to help people pick possible parts that they could then use to build their own PC. This website also has completed builds that other people have done.
* [Chproject](https://chproject.netlify.com/) <br><br>

### Message Coder/Decoder
* This was a project that I created that made an encoder and decoder program in Python using RSA public/private keys and caeser-ciphers.
