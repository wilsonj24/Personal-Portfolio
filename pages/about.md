### Hello There!

I am a current Junior at Allegheny College located in Pennsylvania studying computer science with a focus on cybersecurity. I have some penetration testing knowledge with the use of using shells, SQL injection, and hacking web applications as I have done a few CTF's. I have learned various skills from my coursework allowing me to have an extensive knowledge and understanding of the different types of opportunities that may be open to me. Not only have I coded in multiple languages such as Python, C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc.. but I have databases knowledge working with SQlite3, Django, MongoDB, and Cassandra. My planned graduation date is May 2021.
